## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I practiced styling and creating a good structure for HTML. I don't use any special tool, and do it only by pure HTML-CSS.
In this project I tried to use semantic elements.


### Continued development

I will use more advanced tools like tailwind-css for other projects.
